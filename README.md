## News Paper Article Classification

In many real-world scenarios, the ability to automatically classify news-paper articles into a fixed set of categories (sports, politics, tech etc.) is highly beneficial. News article applications can directly classify the articles into a set of categories and recommend to users based on their interests. Natural Language Processing offers powerful techniques which can be used for classification of various documents. These techniques are predicted on the hypothesis that documents in different categories distinguish themselves by features of the language contained in each document. Salient features for document classification may include word structure, word frequency, and natural language structure in each document.

We already have a large archive of already classified articles, so we are able to make use of supervised classification techniques. Classification algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier etc, can be used to classify the articles. Famous python packages like Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Scikit-Learn can also be used.
