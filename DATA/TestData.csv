The misguided missive purported to help Iran "fully understand our constitutional system" but was widely derided as a meddling and dangerous precedent. Maybe the senators' next letter will reveal how they plan to pay for another Middle East war one that could be averted by a successful deal with the Iranians. That same day Apple rolled out the Apple Watch. Fans are already lining up but do we really need to be even more distracted by endless notifications?

These included "careerism and opportunism" "social exhibitionism" and "spiritual Alzheimer's" seen in those who "become enslaved to the idols that they have built with their own hands."

113379,This week the nation experienced yet another collective shock as a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict an NYPD officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. As Chris Rock tweeted "This one was on film" -- a nod to the grand jury in Ferguson declining to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown just a week earlier. And on Thursday the Justice Department released a damning report about a seemingly out-of-control police force in Cleveland (where a police officer recently killed Tamir Rice a 12-year-old holding a pellet gun). In response to all this largely peaceful protests have broken out across America. The question isn't just how to police our police. The problem is how to fix a broken justice system that has for obvious reasons lost the trust of much of our country. The first step is translating people's anger into political action to reassert accountability and put justice back into the justice system. #BlackLivesMatter,politics

Unlike Bush he has no messianic zealots among his advisers. He gives the kind of well-considered responses that suggest a president who carefully engages with truly difficult policy conundrums.

The White House emphasized the military action's limited scope. "I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq" said the President. But of course even though the U.S. formally withdrew our forces from Iraq in 2011 this is not another war; it's a continuation of the Iraq War which should be renamed The War of Unintended Consequences. Though this week's air strikes however warranted should serve as a sobering rebuke to the kind of thinking that led us into Iraq in the first place the same voices that headed that ill-conceived charge are still front and center -- like Paul Wolfowitz who on Tuesday claimed that America had "won" the war in Iraq "in 2009."

One of the most disgusting slanders by the right against low-income people and especially African Americans is the claim that the subprime collapse resulted from the government pressuring lenders to loan to unqualified borrowers. The vast majority of subprime loans were written by mortgage companies not even covered by federal law. Subprime was a scheme originated on Wall Street to profit from deceiving borrowers.,politics

130605,This week President Obama met with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki over reports of treatment delays. "If these allegations prove to be true it is dishonorable it is disgraceful and I will not tolerate it" said Obama after the meeting. We should absolutely hold accountable those responsible for the recent suffering and deaths of America's veterans. But let's not stop with the VA. One reason the system is so overwhelmed is because of the tens of thousands injured in Iraq an unnecessary war which also claimed over 4400 soldiers' lives. In 2003 Shinseki then serving as Army chief of staff testified it would take "several hundred thousand soldiers" to occupy Iraq. For speaking the truth about the recklessness and hubris behind the invasion he was pushed aside by Bush Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz.
